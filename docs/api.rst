Library API
===========

Highlight.js exports a few functions as methods of the ``hljs`` object.


highlight
---------

::

  highlight(code, {language, ignoreIllegals})

Core highlighting function.  Accepts the code to highlight (string) and a list of options (object).
The ``language`` parameter must be present and specify the language name or alias
of the grammar to be used for highlighting.
The ``ignoreIllegals`` is an optional parameter than when true forces highlighting
to finish even in case of detecting illegal syntax for the
language instead of throwing an exception.

Returns an object with the following properties:

* ``language``: language name, same as the name passed in ``languageName``, returned for consistency with ``highlightAuto``
* ``relevance``: integer value representing the relevance score
* ``value``: HTML string with highlighting markup
* ``top``: top of the current mode stack
* ``illegal``: boolean representing whether any illegal matches were found
* ``code``: the original raw code


highlight (old API)
---------

::

  highlight(languageName, code, ignoreIllegals, continuation)

**This is the old API which we deprecated with 10.7, please see the new API above.**

``continuation`` is an optional mode stack representing unfinished parsing.
When present, the function will restart parsing from this state instead of
initializing a new one.  This is used internally for `sublanguage` support.

Note: `continuation` is NOT intended to support line-by-line highlighting
because there is no requirement that a grammar handle linebreaks in any special
way. It's quite possible for a grammar to have a single mode/regex that matches
MANY lines at once.  This is not discouraged and entirely up to the grammar.


highlightAuto
-------------

::

highlightAuto(code, languageSubset)

Highlighting with language detection.
Accepts a string with the code to highlight and an optional array of language names and aliases restricting detection to only those languages. The subset can also be set with ``configure``, but the local parameter overrides the option if set.

Returns an object with the following properties:

* ``language``: detected language
* ``relevance``: integer value representing the relevance score
* ``value``: HTML string with highlighting markup
* ``secondBest``: object with the same structure for second-best heuristically detected language (may be absent)


highlightElement
----------------

::

  highlightElement(element)

Applies highlighting to a DOM node containing code.

This function is the one to use to apply highlighting dynamically after page load
or within initialization code of third-party JavaScript frameworks.

The function uses language detection by default but you can specify the language
in the ``class`` attribute of the DOM node. See the :doc:`class reference
</css-classes-reference>` for all available language names and aliases.


configure
---------

::

  configure(options)

Configures global options:

* ``classPrefix``: a string prefix added before class names in the generated markup, used for backwards compatibility with stylesheets.
* ``languages``: an array of language names and aliases restricting auto detection to only these languages.
* ``languageDetectRe``: a regex to configure how CSS class names map to language (allows class names like say `color-as-php` vs the default of `language-php`, etc.)
* ``noHighlightRe``: a regex to configure which CSS classes are to be skipped completely.
* ``cssSelector``: a CSS selector to configure which elements are affected by ``hljs.highlightAll``. Defaults to ``'pre code'``.

Accepts an object representing options with the values to updated. Other options don't change
::

  hljs.configure({
    noHighlightRe: /^do-not-highlightme$/i,
    languageDetectRe: /\bgrammar-([\w-]+)\b/i, // for `grammar-swift` style CSS naming
    classPrefix: ''     // don't append class prefix
                        // â€¦ other options aren't changed
  });
  hljs.highlightAll();


highlightAll
------------

Applies highlighting to all elements on a page matching the configured ``cssSelector``.
The default ``cssSelector`` value is ``'pre code'``, which highlights all code blocks.
This can be called before or after the page's ``onload`` event has fired.


initHighlighting
----------------

*Deprecated as of 10.6:* Please use ``highlightAll()`` instead.

Applies highlighting to all elements on a page matching ``cssSelector ``.


initHighlightingOnLoad
----------------------

*Deprecated as of 10.6:* Please use ``highlightAll()`` instead.

Attaches highlighting to the page load event.


registerLanguage
----------------

::

  registerLanguage(languageName, languageDefinition)

Adds new language to the library under the specified name. Used mostly internally.

* ``languageName``: a string with the name of the language being registered
* ``languageDefinition``: a function that returns an object which represents the
  language definition. The function is passed the ``hljs`` object to be able
  to use common regular expressions defined within it.


unregisterLanguage
------------------

::

  unregisterLanguage(languageName)

Removes a language and its aliases from the library. Used mostly internally.

* ``languageName``: a string with the name of the language being removed.


registerAliases
---------------

::

  registerAliases(alias|aliases, {languageName})

Adds new language alias or aliases to the library for the specified language name defined under ``languageName`` key.

* ``alias|aliases``: a string or array with the name of alias being registered
* ``languageName``: the language name as specified by ``registerLanguage``.


listLanguages
-------------

Returns the languages names list.


.. _getLanguage:


getLanguage
-----------

::

  getLanguage(name)

Looks up a language by name or alias.

Returns the language object if found, ``undefined`` otherwise.


debugMode
---------

Enables *debug/development* mode.  **This mode purposely makes Highlight.js more fragile!  It should only be used for testing and local development (of languages or the library itself).**  By default "Safe Mode" is used, providing the most reliable experience for production usage.

For example, if a new version suddenly had a serious bug (or breaking change) that affected only a single language:

* **In Safe Mode**: All other languages would continue to highlight just fine. The broken language would appear as a code block, but without any highlighting (as if it were plaintext).
* **In Debug Mode**: All highlighting would stop when an error was encountered and a JavaScript error would be thrown.
