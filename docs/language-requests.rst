On requesting new languages
===========================

This is a general answer to requests for adding new languages that appear from
time to time in the highlight.js issue tracker and discussion group.

    Highlight.js doesn't have a fundamental plan for implementing languages,
    instead the project works by encouraging develoment of 3rd party language
    grammars from contributors.  We're also happy to host 3rd party language
    grammars at the ``highlightjs`` GitHub organization - no matter how obscure
    or weird.

    This means that *there's no point in requesting a new language without
    providing an implementation for it*. If you want to see a particular language
    included in highlight.js but cannot implement it, the best way to make it
    happen is to get another developer interested in doing so. Here's our
    :doc:`language-guide`.
