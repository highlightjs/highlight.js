# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Due to both time and resource constrains the Highlight.js core team only fully supports the most current major/minor release of the library.  Problems with prior minor releases are often solved by upgrading to the most recent minor release.  Prior major release will only receive critical security updates (when feasible).

| Version  |     | Status  |
| :-----:  | :-: | :------ |
| 10.3.x   | :white_check_mark: |  The 10.x series recieves regular updates, new features & bug fixes. |
| <= 10.2.x  | :x: | *Please upgrade to a more recent release.* |
| 9.18.x   | :closed_lock_with_key: | Security updates only.  See [VERSION_10_UPGRADE.md](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/blob/master/VERSION_10_UPGRADE.md). |
| <= 9.17.x | :x: | Obsolete. |
| 8.x      | :x: | Obsolete. |
| 7.x      | :x: | Obsolete. |
| Older    | :x: | Obsolete. |

### Version 9

Support for IE11 is really the only reason anyone should still prefer version 9. It's recommended that everyone else upgrade.
