Syntax highlighting is an action applying to one thing.
Understand "highlight [something preferably codeish]" as syntax highlighting.

Code is a kind of thing. Code is usually plural-named.

Code can be highlighted. Code is usually not highlighted.

Check syntax highlighting:
  unless the noun is code:
    say "[The noun] isn't source code you can highlight.";
    rule fails.

Carry out syntax highlighting:
  now the noun is highlighted.
