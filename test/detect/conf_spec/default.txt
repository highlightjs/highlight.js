# GLOBAL SETTINGS
# Use the [default] stanza to define any global settings.
#  * You can also define global settings outside of any stanza, at the top
#    of the file.
#  * Each conf file should have at most one default stanza. If there are
#    multiple default stanzas, attributes are combined. In the case of
#    multiple definitions of the same attribute, the last definition in the
#    file wins.
#  * If an attribute is defined at both the global level and in a specific
#    stanza, the value in the specific stanza takes precedence.
maxresults = integer
# Set the global maximum number of search results sent via alerts.
# Defaults to 100.
hostname = [protocol]<host>[:<port>]
# Sets the hostname used in the web link (url) sent in alerts.
# This value accepts two forms.
# * hostname
#      examples: splunkserver, splunkserver.example.com
# * protocol://hostname:port
#      examples: http://splunkserver:8000, https://splunkserver.example.com:443
# When this value is a simple hostname, the protocol and port which
# are configured within splunk are used to construct the base of
# the url.
# When this value begins with 'http://', it is used verbatim.
# NOTE: This means the correct port must be specified if it is not
# the default port for http or https.
# This is useful in cases when the Splunk server is not aware of
# how to construct an externally referenceable url, such as SSO
# environments, other proxies, or when the Splunk server hostname
# is not generally resolvable.
# Defaults to current hostname provided by the operating system,
# or if that fails, "localhost".
# When set to empty, default behavior is used.
ttl     = <integer>[p]
# Optional argument specifying the minimum time to live (in seconds)
# of the search artifacts, if this action is triggered.
# If p follows integer, then integer is the number of scheduled periods.
# If no actions are triggered, the artifacts will have their ttl determined
# by the "dispatch.ttl" attribute in savedsearches.conf.
# Defaults to 10p
# Defaults to 86400 (24 hours)   for: email, rss
# Defaults to   600 (10 minutes) for: script
# Defaults to   120 (2 minutes)  for: summary_index, populate_lookup
maxtime = <integer>[m|s|h|d]
# The maximum amount of time that the execution of an action is allowed to
# take before the action is aborted.
# Use the d, h, m and s suffixes to define the period of time:

# reference the search, use $search$

forceCsvResults = auto|<bool>
# If set to a true boolean, any saved search that includes this action will
# always store results in CSV format, instead of the internal SRS format.
# If set to a false boolean, results will always be serialized using the
# internal SRS format.
# If set to "auto", results will be serialized as CSV if the 'command' setting
# in this stanza starts with "sendalert" or contains the string
# "$results.file$".
# Defaults to "auto".
alert.execute.cmd = <string>
# For custom alert actions: Explicitly specify the command to be executed
# when the alert action is triggered. This refers to a binary or script
# in the bin folder of the app the alert action is defined in, or to a
# path pointer file, also located in the bin folder.
# If a path pointer file (*.path) is specified, the contents of the file
# is read and the result is used as the command to be executed.
# Environment variables in the path pointer file are substituted.
# If a python (*.py) script is specified it will be prefixed with the
# bundled python interpreter.
alert.execute.cmd.arg.<n> = <string>
