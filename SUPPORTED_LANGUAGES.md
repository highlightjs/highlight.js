# Supported Languages

The table below shows the full list of languages (and corresponding classes/aliases) supported by Highlight.js.  Languages that list a **Package** below are 3rd party languages and are not bundled with the core library.  You can find their repositories by following the links.

**Note:** The languages available will depend on how you've built or are included the library in your app. For example our default minified web build includes only ~40 popular languages.  See [Getting the Library][1] and [Importing the Library][2] in the README for examples of how to load additional/specific languages.
