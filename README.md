# Highlight.js

Highlight.js highlights syntax in code examples on blogs, forums and
in fact on any web pages. It's very easy to use because it works
automatically: finds blocks of code, detects a language, highlights it.

Autodetection can be fine tuned when it fails by itself (see "Heuristics").


## Installation and usage

Downloaded package includes file "highlight.pack.js" which is a full compressed
version of the library intended to use in production. All uncompressed source
files are also available, feel free to look into them!

The script is installed by linking to a single file and making a single
initialization call:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="highlight.pack.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();
    </script>

Also you can replaces TAB ('\x09') characters used for indentation in your code
with some fixed number of spaces or with a `<span>` to set them special styling:

    <script type="text/javascript">
      hljs.tabReplace = '    '; // 4 spaces
      // ... or
      hljs.tabReplace = '<span class="indent">\t</span>';

      hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();
    </script>

Then the script looks in your page for fragments `<pre><code>...</code></pre>`
that are used traditionally to mark up code examples. Their content is
marked up by logical pieces with defined class names.


### Custom initialization

If you use different markup for code blocks you can initialize them manually
with `highlightBlock(code, tabReplace)` function. It takes a DOM element
containing the code to highlight and optionally a string with which to replace
TAB characters.

Initialization using for example jQuery might look like this:

    $(document).ready(function() {
      $('pre code').each(function(i, e) {hljs.highlightBlock(e, '    ')});
    });

If your code container relies on `<br>` tags instead of line breaks (i.e. if
it's not `<pre>`) pass `true` into third parameter of `highlightBlock`:

    $('div.code').each(function(i, e) {hljs.highlightBlock(e, null, true)});


### Styling

Elements of code marked up with classes can be styled as desired:

    .comment {
      color: gray;
    }

    .keyword {
      font-weight: bold;
    }

    .python .string {
      color: blue;
    }

    .html .atribute .value {
      color: green;
    }

Highligt.js comes with several style themes located in "styles" directory that
can be used directly or as a base for your own experiments.

## Export

File export.html contains a little program that shows and allows to copy and paste
an HTML code generated by the highlighter for any code snippet. This can be useful
in situations when one can't use the script itself on a site.


## Heuristics

Autodetection of a code's language is done with a simple heuristics:
the program tries to highlight a fragment with all available languages and
counts all syntactic structures that it finds along the way. The language
with greatest count wins.

This means that in short fragments the probability of an error is high
(and it really happens sometimes). In this cases you can set the fragment's
language explicitly by assigning a class to the `<code>` element:

    <pre><code class="html">...</code></pre>

You can use class names recommended in HTML5: "language-html",
"language-php". Classes also can be assigned to the `<pre>` element.

To disable highlighting of a fragment altogether use "no-highlight" class:

    <pre><code class="no-highlight">...</code></pre>
