**Describe the issue**
<!-- A clear and concise description of what the issue seems to be. -->

**Which language seems to have the issue?**
<!--
Please specify exactly *which* language grammar you are using to highlight (`python`, `javascript`, etc.) or specify if you are using auto-detection.  If you are using auto-detection please first check to make sure the language you are expecting was properly detected.  If Highlight.js misidentifies the type of code - then the highlighting may be entirely incorrect - and there often isn't much we can do about that - auto-detection is only best-effort and can't guess right 100% of the time.
-->

**Are you using `highlight` or `highlightAuto`?**

...

**Sample Code to Reproduce**
<!--
Please include plain text examples of the code that fails to highlight properly or can reproduce the bug you are seeing.  If you attach a screenshot PLEASE also provide the actually code that we can copy/paste if necessary to help resolve the issue.

A jsfiddle can sometimes be even better.  You can fork an example test case:

**Expected behavior**
<!--
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.  A screenshot might help here if another highlighting library gets it right, or is Github highlights it better/properly you can use a GitHub code block.

**Additional context**

Add any other context about the problem here.
